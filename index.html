  <ol class="project__section-content">
    <li><strong>Understand the problem</strong><br>Interview users or review user research to develop an understanding of the user's goals. Set goals for what you hope to achive.</li>
    <li><strong>Understand the current solutions</strong><br>Examine how users are currently solving their problems. Are they currently using a different app to solve this problem? An excel spreadsheet? A pen and paper?</li>
    <li><strong>Ideation and sketching</strong><br>diverge and explore possible solutions to the problem in the form of sketching. Keep the sketches simple to iterate through ideas quickly.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Prototyping</strong><br>Review the sketches and pick the best ideas, or combination of the best ideas, and present them in a high enough fidelity to properly convey how the interface will function.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Testing</strong><br>Present the prototype to as many users as possible. Gather feedback. Iterate based on that feedback.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Implementation</strong><br>build the damn thing...</li>
    <li><strong>Measure and iterate</strong><br>What's working? How could it be better? Continue to improve in a measurable way.</li>
  </ol>
