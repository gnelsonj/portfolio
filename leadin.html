  <h4 class="project__section-title">Description</h4>
  <p class="project__section-content">LeadIn is a unique project in that it's a 2-man team within HubSpot building a brand new product. We havent't used any HubSpot resources and are essentially operating as a start-up. We were tasked with building a free WordPress plugin to allow for some type of marketing functionality. What that functionality was, was up to us. We spent a month doing customer interviews and honing in on a simple core usecase. We decided on simple lead tracking that works right out of the box.</p>
